# robot-me-baby

**robot-me-baby** is little demo app designed to demonstrate the features and power of [ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) - a react renderer for the CLI.

## Usage

Download and install.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ianhaggerty/robot-me-baby
cd robot-me-baby
npm install .
```

### Production

Compile and run.

```shell
npm run compile
npm run start
```

### Development

1. Spin up a babel command to watch the `src` directory for changes.

   ```shell
   npm run watch
   ```

2. In another CLI instance, use nodemon to watch the `lib` directory.

   ```shell
   npm run nodemon
   ```

## ðŸŒŽ Road Map

- [Routing Solution](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/MemoryRouter) React Router was built for the browser, but it has a `MemoryRouter` that can be used in different environments.
- **Pew Pew Lasers?** There is no absolute positioning as part of the Ink library. Splasers from one's eyeballs would be fun, but ni-un impossible to implement using flexbox.
- **Switch Focus on KeyPress** Imperatively changing focus using the `Ink` library is not possible (only `next` and `previous`). A [recent commit](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink/issues/426) has pushed this, so just waiting for release cycle.
- Redux (Little Boilerplate)

## Learning Links

This is a bunch of stuff I stumbled across whilst developing. Largely kept here for my own benefit.

- [nodemon: Option to allow stdin to be inherited](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/issues/1036) Nodemon hijacks the stdin readstream and does unwanted things. This can make it difficult to develop CLI with an auto refresh... Hot reload would be 10x better. I quickly rolled my own solution in this repo.
- [node: reading keystrokes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5006821/nodejs-how-to-read-keystrokes-from-stdin) See answer from Dan Heberden. Raw Mode basically means, feed me what the user types - nothing else! (Including ctrl-c)
- [debug typescript with jest](https://medium.com/@mtiller/debugging-with-typescript-jest-ts-jest-and-visual-studio-code-ef9ca8644132)
  This gets the job done.
- [mapping an empty array](https://itnext.io/heres-why-mapping-a-constructed-array-doesn-t-work-in-javascript-f1195138615a) Basically you can't call `.map` on an uninitialized array as the pointers don't point to anything yet. Therefore, the implementation considers there to be nothing to _map_ over.
- [Array.prototype.map weirdness](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5501581/javascript-new-arrayn-and-array-prototype-map-weirdness)
  `array.map` doesn't work on array's created with `new Array(size)`.
- [muted color palette](https://id.pinterest.com/pin/761389880740038172/)
  Muted Colors for the robots!
- [string.replace](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace#specifying_a_function_as_a_parameter) You can pass a function instead of a string - useful when matching regExp patterns.
- [setTimeout & react state](https://upmostly.com/tutorials/settimeout-in-react-components-using-hooks) Ordinarily, setTimeout takes a function - and that function captures the enclosing scope. Within that scope may be variables populated by state hooks. Therefore, state from accessed within setTimeout isn't necessarily up to date. **In hindsight, it's better to `useEffect` and respond to state changes as necessary**. _see below_
- [TS getters and setters](https://www.typescripttutorial.net/typescript-tutorial/typescript-getters-setters/#:~:text=Introduction%20to%20TypeScript%20Getters%20and%20Setters&text=The%20getters%20and%20setters%20allow,the%20properties%20of%20a%20class.&text=A%20getter%20method%20returns%20the,method%20updates%20the%20property's%20value.) I'm a big fan of getters / setters in TS. However, they must be used carefully in React. If you're wrapping data with classes (like I do here), you need to **make sure your classes are immutable** - well, at least if you intend to use them as React State within a component. The react diff algorithm only does shallow test (test by reference or value for a primitive).
- [Cleaning up Timers using Hooks](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53464595/how-to-use-componentwillmount-in-react-hooks) This is critical knowledge for a React developer!
- [Understanding esModuleInterop in tsconfig file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56238356/understanding-esmoduleinterop-in-tsconfig-file)
- [When to use JSX.Element vs ReactNode vs ReactElement?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58123398/when-to-use-jsx-element-vs-reactnode-vs-reactelement)

## Thank You

To the awesome people behind [Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink), the React-Renderer used extensively in this project.

\+ The Gazzillion other people whose work I've sponged and reincarnated as my own. Projects like this have a heap of dependencies.
